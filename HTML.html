                <p>Nyanners is a gentle, sensitive, and often energetic catgirl with a good sense of humor. However,
                    her claims of being "seiso" or pure are offset by a tendency to use toilet jokes and reference
                    adult,
                    and often vastly obscure, topics. This contrast between pure and crude is considered by fans to be a
                    defining aspect of Nyanners' appeal.</p>
                <p>She has an intense laugh, which she does very often, including at her own jokes. Her sense of humor
                    is
                    often complex and layered, but at other times it is simple but extremely abstract, such as laughing
                    uncontrollably while playing half-life scientist screaming sounds at 50% speed. Some of these bits
                    she
                    does can be very involved and dragged out, at one time doing bad stand up comedy for an hour
                    straight.
                    However, her creativity, active mind, and commitment to the joke can make the entire length
                    enjoyable.
                </p>
                <p>She has ADHD and is very easily distracted or sidetracked. She may end a stream over an hour
                    after she said she was already ending, discuss a subject for several minutes while walking in a
                    circle in a video game, or change a topic rapidly and successively, often meaning her streams are
                    never boring.

                <p>Nyanners is a catgirl with fluffy pink hair. It has an ahoge on top, and her cat ears have soft fur
                    inside them. Her hair hides a second set of human ears. She has a singular fang on her left side,
                    this is her only tooth. She has purple eyes (usually) because it is Nyanners' favorite color.</p>

                <p> Her default costume is a pale blue hoodie, which hangs off her shoulders because, although it is
                    comfy, it is also too warm. She wears a black and white top underneath which says „Å´„ÇÉ„Çì„Äú, the Japanese
                    spelling of "nyan~". Her hair and clothes are decorated with cat motifs. She often changes her
                    appearance to match the season.</p>
                <p>She occasionally receives minor model changes. On 3 November 2020, Nyanners' default outfit gained a
                    variant with a new hair clip depicting a cat ghost wearing an eyepatch. It replaces her original
                    hair
                    clip of a simple cat face. The cat ghost represents Nyanners' true form as an otherworldly eldritch
                    spirit for whom Nyatasha Nyanners is just the latest in series of haunted vessels; while the
                    eyepatch
                    represents Yakuza character Goro Majima. However, occasionally used the old version in streams.
                    She also received oversized breasts for a one-off April Fools stream, and a lighter pink hair color
                    when her previous form apparently died on 5 May 2021.</p>

                <h2 class="title-name">History</h2>
                <h3>2020</h3>
                <p>On 17 July, after several years of streaming on Twitch using various Facerig avatars due to shyness,
                    Nyanners revealed her custom virtual avatar. On 21 July she posted her character bio, revealing
                    the official name Nyatasha Nyanners. The name was selected by a series of polls on Nyanners'
                    Discord.
                    Rejected names included Nyanzu Nyanneru, Nyanasu Nyanners, and Nyatasha Kotova Neru III.

                    Nyanners announced reaching 100,000 Twitch followers on 29 July 2020, and 200,000 followers on 10
                    Oct
                    2020.</p>

                <h3>2021</h3>
                <p>On 1 January, Nyanners posted a YouTube video where she was executed for failing to reach 1 million
                    subscribers by the end of 2020. In her Twitch stream later that day, she was replaced by a new
                    clone,
                    identified by having golden eyes rather than purple and a lack of familiarity with wife-stealing.
                    She gained 7,000 new subscribers that day and subsequently reached 1 million subscribers on 2
                    January.
                </p>
                <p>On 8 January, Nyanners posted What really happened on that fateful day..., revealing that she
                    survived
                    by deflecting the bullet with her Cold Steel sword cane, only to trip over a rock, hit her head on
                    another rock and die in the snow. On 16 January she held a 1 million subscriber celebration YouTube
                    stream attended by over peak 12,000 viewers, in which the original Nyatasha Nyanners was revealed to
                    have survived by drinking her own pee.

                    On 24 March, Nyanners was announced as a guest in Kizuna AI's first virtual U.S. tour.

                    She reached 400,000 Twitch followers on 31 March.</p>
